## 🎯 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO (5 minutes)

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
**Go to:** https://github.com/new
- Repository name: `my-django-react-app`
- Visibility: Public (or Private)  
- **Don't** initialize with README
- Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push Your Code
```powershell
# Replace with your actual GitHub username and repo name
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Set Up Google Cloud (For Deployment)
```powershell
# Create project (choose unique project ID)
gcloud projects create my-unique-project-id-123
gcloud config set project my-unique-project-id-123

# Enable billing: https://console.cloud.google.com/billing
```

### 4. Configure GitHub Secrets & Deploy
Follow the detailed instructions in `GITHUB_SETUP.md`

## 💡 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
- Push to GitHub → Automatic deployment via GitHub Actions
- Professional CI/CD pipeline  
- Zero manual work after setup

### Option 2: Manual Deployment  
- Use `deploy.ps1` script
- Run whenever you want to deploy
- Good for testing deployment process

### Option 3: Local Development
```powershell  
# Start Docker Desktop first, then:
docker compose up --build
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend: http://localhost:8000
```
